# Stochastic practical Matlab code

## Overview

All the code used in the analysis done for the AE4304P practical assignment simulating the longitudinal response of an aircraft to stochastic vertical gust input.

## Structure and running

Run *main.m* section by section. Each section reflects one of the tasks in the assignment reader.
 
The *functions* folder contains relevant outside functions constructed. Most of them are based on the example code provided in the folder *ML_ae4304*
